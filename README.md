# Whitespace Normalization

### Problem

Given a non-standard term **t** (eg. _senatoradmits_), split the term into two words **a** (senator) and **b**(admits) such that both **a** and **b** are valid terms. 

This project aims to build simple lightweight systems to address this problem.

### Approach
Refer to this [note](http://markdownnotes.com/app/#/?note=20819) to get the basic math of the underlying approach.

### Code and Data

- The `code` directory contains the code for the implementation of all the models described in the note.
- The `examples` directory contains a jupyter notebook which demonstrates how the approach works in practice and a command line script to get all tokens in a document whitespace normalized.

### TODO
(a) Put notebooks and scripts together.
(b) Consider hosting the ngrams dictionary.
