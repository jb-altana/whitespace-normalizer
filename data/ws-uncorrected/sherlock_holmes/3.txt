One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice), when my wayled me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door, which mustalways be associated
in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keendesire to see Holmes
again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms werebrilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
his tall, spare figure passtwice in a darksilhouette against
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
own story. Hewas at work again. He hadrisen out of his
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem. I rang the bell and wasshown up to the chamber which
had formerlybeen in part my own.
